							MAN ON THE MOON: We could be first to know..When U.S astronauts take their first historic steps on the moon's surface, Ausatralia could be first to Know.

		The information will come from Honeysuckle Creek, a $10 million tracking station buried in hills about 25 miles from Canberra.

		Appolo Mainline, man's first lunar landind, scheduled for next june or july, will end two year's work for staff at the lonely outpost.
	
		Few australians are aware of the vital role Honey-suckle Creek and its nearby "sister" station Tidbinbilla will play in this epic flight.

		Honeysuckle was opened in March, 1967 by the then Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt. As part of the manned space flight network, it was de-signed for one purpose the Tracking of lunar spacecraft.
